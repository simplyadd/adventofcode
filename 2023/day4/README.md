Day 4: 

Part 1 adds all the points from winning numbers.
Each card (line) has a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have separated by '|' symbol.
The first match makes the card worth one point and each match after the first doubles the point value of that card.

Part 2 gets total scratchcards you end up with.
There's no such thing as "points". Instead, scratchcards only cause you to win more scratchcards equal to the number of winning numbers you have.
Specifically, you win copies of the scratchcards below the winning card equal to the number of matches. So, if card 10 were to have 5 matching numbers, you would win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
This process repeats until none of the copies cause you to win any more cards.
