Day 5: 

Part 1 gets the lowest location number from initial seed numbers.
The almanac starts by listing which seeds need to be planted.
The rest of the almanac contains a list of maps which describe how to convert numbers from a source category into numbers in a destination category.

Part 3 is the same but the seed numbers come in pairs.
Within each pair, the first value is the start of the range and the second value is the length of the range.
